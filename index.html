		<h1 class = "h1">Animal Killings per Airport</h1>
		<p>
			To decrease the chances of a flock of birds colliding with turbines of landing and departing flights, New York’s Port Authority airports have explored a range of options. The Port Authority fires pyrotechnics into the sky to scare birds away from the airport, and instructs pilots to try to minimize the amount of time spent at altitudes where birds commonly fly. But the Port Authority also turns to a rather more old-fashioned approach: getting rid of the animals by shooting them with firearms. 
</p><p>
Even for the most frequent of flyers, aware of airports’ efforts to use latest technologies to ensure their safety (for example, with full body scanners), this may come as surprising. And yet part of airports’ on-the-ground staff include trained marksmen - which the Port Authority describes as “Wildlife biologists” - whose job it is to kill birds or animals which may be hazardous to incoming or outgoing flights. 
</p><p>
Earlier this year, the New York Post obtained a Freedom of Information request documenting the number and type of birds killed by the Port Authority in 2012-2013. The data also reveals the methods that “wildlife biologists” use to kill the animals. 
</p><p>
Cody Baciuska, vice president at Loomacres Wildlife Management, an FAA approved wildlife management company, said the killing of birds is used as a last option when trying to mitigate the risk of aircraft bird strikes. “If a biologist needs to kill an animal,’ said Baciuska, “before he does so, he has to harass it 1000 times” in order to scare it away from the area. However, Baciuska notes, people’s safety comes first. 
</p><p>
What’s immediately striking about the Port Authority data is the sheer number of the killings that occur nearly every day at each of New York’s busiest airports. For example, on certain days up to 250 animals are killed: July 13th, 2012, saw 258 Laughing Gulls shot by firearm at John F. Kennedy Airport, and October 16th, 2012, saw 138 Brown-headed Cowbirds killed at Newark Airport.
</p><p>
Aside from the startling rates of bird killings, further data analysis reveals interesting differences between the airport killing rates. A far more significant number of birds are killed at JFK compared to the other airports. Between 2012 and 2013, 14,865 animals were killed at JFK. This is nearly three times the total number killed at Newark, La Guardia, Teterboro and Stewart airports combined (5,444).

		<p>Visualizing the data also revealed the seasonal pattern that affects the amount of birds flying within dangerous proximity of inbound and outbound flights. The chart above shows a very obvious peak in bird killings at JFK in July of each year.

		In terms of methods to eliminate problem-causing wildlife, birds are most commonly shot by firearm or euthanized. According to an article published in USA Today, euthanization entails herding up the birds into a pen and gassing them with carbon dioxide. As per the bar chart above, killing birds by firearm appears to be the far more popular method overall, but while killings by firearm dropped from around 11,500 in 2012 to around 5,000 in 2013, euthanization saw a slight increase of over 300 counts in 2013, from 1,780 in 2012.

		<h1 class="h1"> How Animals Were Killed</h1>
		<p>
			The final chart above, which shows the number of birds killed by species, reveals that laughing gulls are the number one bird type killed by airports’ wildlife biologists. 
</p><p>
According to Don Riepe, Northeast Chapter Director of the American Littoral Society, a conservation organization, the first nesting pair of laughing gulls was found in the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge in 1978. By 1990, there were 7,500 nesting pair right next to the JFK runways, which are located near marshlands - an ideal habitat for these types of birds. 
</p><p>
In 1991, the Port Authority issued the first permit to kill the gulls. According to Reipe, in the first year alone, 14,000 gulls were killed, but this didn’t have a significant impact on the overall gull population. Today, there are about 2,500 nesting pair of Laughing Gulls yearly, with populations flourishing in the summer months, and between 2012 and 2013, nearly 6,000 Laughing Gulls were killed.
